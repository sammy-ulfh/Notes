# Shell type

- __sh__ or __Bourne Shell__: the original shell still using on UNIX systems and UNIX-related environments. This is the basic shell, a small program with few features. While this is not the standard shell, it is still available on every Linux system for compatibility with UNIX programs.
- __bash__ or __Bourne Again Shell__: the standard GNU Shell, intuitive and flexible. Probably most advisable for beginning users while being at the same time a powerful tool for the advanced and professional user. On Linux, bash is the standard shell for common users. This shell a so-called superset of the Bourne Shell, a set of add-ons and plug-ins. This means that the Bourne Again Shell is compatible with the Bourne Shell: commands that work in sh, also work in bash. However, the reverse is not always the case.
- __csh__ or __C Shell__: the syntax of this shell resembles that of the C programming language. Sometimes asked for by programmers.
- __tcsh__ or __TENEX C Shell__: a superset of the common C Shell, enhancing user-friendliness and speed. That is why some also call it the Turbo C Shell.
- __ksh__ or the __Korn Shell__: sometimes appreciated by people with UNIX background. A superset of the Bourne Shell; with standard configuration a nightmare for beginning users.
