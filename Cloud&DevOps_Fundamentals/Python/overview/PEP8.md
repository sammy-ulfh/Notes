# PEP8

**PEP 8**, sometimes spelled **PEP8** or **PEP-8**, is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The primary focus of **PEP 8** is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.

**PEP** stands for **Python Enhancement Proposal**, and there are several of them. A **PEP** is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.

**PEP8**:  [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

**PEP 8** exists to improve the readability of Python code. But why is readability so important? Why is writing readable code one of the guiding principles of the Python language?

As Guido van Rossum said, “Code is read much more often than it is written.” You may spend a few minutes, or a whole day, writing a piece of code to process user authentication. Once you’ve written it, you’re never going to write it again. But you’ll definitely have to read it again. That piece of code might remain part of a project you’re working on. Every time you go back to that file, you’ll have to remember what that code does and why you wrote it, so readability matters.
