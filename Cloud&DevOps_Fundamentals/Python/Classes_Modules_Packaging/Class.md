# Class

Primitive data structures—like numbers, strings, and lists—are designed to represent simple pieces of information, such as the cost of an apple, the name of a poem, or your favorite colors, respectively. What if you want to represent something more complex?

For example, let’s say you want to track employees in an organization. You need to store some basic information about each employee, such as their name, age, position, and the year they started working.

**Classes** are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.

Class structure:

```python
class ClassName:
    """Optional class documentation string"""
	
    class_suite
```

Example:

```python
class Employee:
    """Common base class for all employees"""

    empCount = 0

    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
        Employee.empCount += 1

    def displayCount(self):
        print("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount)

    def displayEmployee(self):
        print("Name :", self.name, ", Salary:", self.salary)
```

The properties that all Employee objects must have been defined in a method called **__init__()**. Every time a new Employee object is created, __init__() sets the initial state of the object by assigning the values of the object’s properties. That is, __init__() initializes each new instance of the class. You can give __init__() any number of parameters, but the first parameter will always be a variable called self. When a new class instance is created, the instance is automatically passed to the self parameter in __init__() so that new attributes can be defined on the object.

## Creating instance of class

A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn’t actually contain any data. The Employee class specifies that a name and a salary are necessary for defining an employee, but it doesn’t contain the name or salary of any specific employee.

While the **class** is the blueprint, an **instance** is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the Employee class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual employee with a name, like John, with a defined salary.

When an instance is created,  `__init__()` method is invoked. `name` and `salary` parameters are required by `__init__` method of `Employee` class.

```python
emp = Employee("John Smith", 200)
```

## Accessing attributes and methods

```python
# First object of Employee class
emp1 = Employee("Slave", 200)
# Second object of Employee class
emp2 = Employee("Master", 5000)

emp1.displayEmployee()
emp2.displayEmployee()

print("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount)  
  
------  
Output:  
Name: Slave, salary: 200  
Name: Master, salare: 500  
Total Employee 2
```

## Attributes modification

```python
emp1.age = 7  # Add an 'age' attribute
emp1.age = 8  # Modify 'age' attribute
del emp1.age  # Delete 'age' attribute
```

```python
# Returns true if 'age' attribute exists
hasattr(emp1, 'age')
# Returns value of 'age' attribute
getattr(emp1, 'age')
# Set attribute 'age' at 8
setattr(emp1, 'age', 8)
# Delete attribute 'age'
delattr(emp1, 'age')
```

## Inheritance

**Inheritance** allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
**Parent** class is the class being inherited from, also called **base** class.
**Child** class is the class that inherits from another class, also called **derived** class.

```python
class Base1:
    def fun(self):
        print("base1.fun")

class Base2():
    def jump(self):
        print("base2.jump")

class Child(Base1, Base2):
    def fun(self):
        print("child.fun")
        super().fun()

c = Child()
c.fun()   # child.fun base1.fun
c.jump()  # base2.jump
```

When a method or attribute of a class is accessed, Python uses the class MRO (method resolution order) to find it.

In Python, the MRO is from bottom to top and left to right. This means that, first, the method is searched in the class of the object. If it’s not found, it is searched in the immediate super class. In the case of multiple super classes, it is searched left to right, in the order by which was declared by the developer.

For example, fun() method is defined in Child class. And it is invoked. jump() method isn't implemented in Child class. Child class has 2 parents: Base1 and Base2. MRO algorithm looks into Base1 first (from left to right) and then in Base2.  That is why Base2.jump is executed.

The Python **super()** function is used in the child class to refer to the parent class and access all the parent class's functions and variables.

## Private variables (name mangling)

“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.

Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called **name mangling**. Any identifier of the form __secretCount(at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with _JustCounter__secretCount, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definition of a class.

```python
class JustCounter:
    __secretCount = 0

    def count(self):
        self.__secretCount += 1
        print(self.__secretCount)

counter = JustCounter()
counter.count()  # 1
counter.count()  # 2

print(counter.__secretCount)  # AttributeError
print(counter._JustCounter__secretCount)   # 2
```

## Magic Methods (operators)

![[class_methods.png]]

**Magic** **methods** in Python are the special methods that start and end with the **double underscores**. They are also called **dunder** **methods**. Magic methods are not meant to be invoked directly by you, but the invocation happens internally from the class on a certain action. For example, when you add two numbers using the + operator, internally, the __add__() method will be called.

You can find all Python magic method descriptions here: [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names)

## Operator overloading

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def __str__(self):
        return f'Vector ({self.a}, {self.b})'

    def __add__(self,other):
        return Vector(self.a + other.a, self.b + other.b)

v1 = Vector(2,10)
v2 = Vector(5,-2)
print(v1 + v2) # print calls __str__ method implicitly to convert Vector object to string

------  
Output:  
Vector (7, 8)
```
