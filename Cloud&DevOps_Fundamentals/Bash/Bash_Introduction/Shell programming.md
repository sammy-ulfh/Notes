# Shell programming

__SHELL__ is also a programming language:

- The syntax is simple and straightforward
- Most short scripts work right the first time
- Debugging is straightforward


The shell program interprets user commands, which are either directly entered by the user, or which can be read from a file called the shell script or shell program.

Shell scripts are __interpreted__, not compiled. The shell reads commands from the script line per line and searches for those commands on the system, while a compiles converts a program into machine readable form, an executable file - which may then be used on a shell script.
