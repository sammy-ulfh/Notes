# Introduction to Unix-Based Operating Systems

- 1969-1970 - The Unix operating system was implemented and released by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.
- 1977 - Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) released another free operating system project contianed Unix code.
- 1983 - Richard Stallman started the GNU Project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.
- 1986 - Maurice J. Bach Published The Desing of The Unix Operating System.
- 1987 - MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andres S. Tanenbaum.
- 1991 - Linus Tolvards began a project that later became the Linux Kernel and on 25 August 1991 he announced this system in a Usenet posting to the newsgroup "com.os.minix". Development was done on MINIX using the GNU  C compiler.
- 1992 - releasing kernel under GNU GPL.
- 1996 - official mascot, penguin.

## Linux

- Unix-like computer operating system.
- Assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distributions.
- The defining component of Linux is the Linux Kernel.

## Kernel

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. On most systems, it is one of the first programs loaded on start-up (after the bootloader). It handles the rest of start-up as well as input/output requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit. It handles memory and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers.
