## Introduction

Defensive Security is the counterpart of Offensive Security. Its concerned with two main tasks:

- Preventing intrusions from occurring
- Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding property

Blue Teams are part of the Defensive Security landscape.

Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:

- User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their system.
- Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protect adequately.
- Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
- Setting up preventative security devices: Firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventativ security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Propper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities and intrusions. If a few unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.

There is much more to defensive security. Aside from the above, we will also cover the following related topics:

- Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Threat intelligence 
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Malware Analysis

So, Which team focuses on defensive security?


## Areas of defensive security

We will cover two main topics related to defensive security:

- Security Operations Center (SOC), where we cover Threat intlligence.
- Digital Forensics and incident response (DFIR), where we also cover Malware Analisys

### Security Operations Center

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and it systems to detect malicious cyber security events. Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:

- **Vulnerabilities**: Whenever a system vulnerability (weakness) is discovers, it is essential to fix it by installing a proper update or patch. When a fix is unavailable, the necessary measure should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it. Although remediating vulnerabilities is vital to a SOC, it is not necessarily assigned to them.
- **Policy violations:** A security policy is a set of rules required to protect the network and systems. For example, it might be a policy violation if users upload confidential company data to an online storage service.
- **Unauthorized activity:** Consider the case where a user's login name and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network. A SOC must detect and block such and evnet as soon as possible before further damage is done.
- **Network intrusions:**
