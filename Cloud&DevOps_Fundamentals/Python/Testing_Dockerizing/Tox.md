# Tox

**tox** aims to automate and standardize testing in Python. It is part of a larger vision of easing the packaging, testing, and release process of Python software.

## What is tox?

tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for:

- checking that your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters
- running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice
- acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
